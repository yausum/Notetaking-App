### Getting Better Results

#### ✅ Good Descriptions
```
"Create a study plan for learning React in 4 weeks with daily tasks"

```

#### ❌ Less Effective
```
"note"  (too vague)
"stuff"  (not descriptive)
"..."  (no context)
```

### Using Different Languages

### Use Generate When:

---

## 🚀 Best Practices

Better: "Workout plan for Monday: bench press 3 sets, tricep dips 3 sets, push-ups 2 sets"
```

### 2. Include Context
```
Basic: "Meeting tomorrow"
Better: "Team meeting tomorrow to discuss Q1 results and plan Q2 strategy"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Please describe what you want to note"

### Generated Note Doesn't Match Expectations
- **Cause**: Description unclear or AI interpretation
- **Solution**: 
  1. Click Regenerate
  2. Modify your description to be more specific
  3. Or save and edit manually

### Tags Not Showing in Preview
- **Cause**: AI didn't generate tags
- **Solution**: Save note and add tags manually in edit page

  1. Check console for errors
  2. Try again
  3. Copy content and create manually if needed
